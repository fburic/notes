# Approaches to Problem Solving

## Check assumptions!
- identify and list all assumptions, event trivial ones
- are you solving the right problem?
- be careful about "intuitive truths"

## Characterize the problem 
- scales of the entities involved
- costs of operations
- [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis)

## Iteratively formalize
1. start from an "explicit enough" natural language description
2. reformulate, introducing rigurous and consistent definitions
3. maintain concepts as generic as feasible, to ease finding approaches across different domains

Steps 1 and 2 are a simplified form of Dijkstra's approach to writing correct programs: [EWD241](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD241.html), [EWD227](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD02xx/EWD227.html), ?
