# Approaches to Problem Solving

## Characterize the problem 
- scales of the entities involved
- costs of operations
- [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis)

## Iteratively formalize (Dijkstra approach)
- start from a "explicit enough" natural language description
- reformulate, introducing rigurous and consistent definitions
- maintain concepts as generic as feasible, to ease finding approaches across different domains

## Check assumptions!
- identify and list all assumptions, event trivial ones
- be careful about "intuitive truths"
