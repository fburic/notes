# Things to consider when working with models

## Describe behaviour of functions characterizing the model or data

For e.g. scores, other measures, give:

* domain and range of values
* special values and any associated interpretation (e.g. 0 values, singularities, etc) 
* significance of any value subsets (e.g. what could be considered a "high score")
