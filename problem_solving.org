#+title: Approaches to Problem Solving

* Characterize the problem 
- scales of the entities involved
- costs of operations
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis][dimensional analysis]]

* Iteratively formalize (Dijkstra approach)
- start from a "explicit enough" natural language description
- reformulate, introducing rigurous and consistent definitions
- maintain concepts as generic as feasible, to ease finding the approach across different domains

* Assumptions!
- identify and list all assumptions, event trivial ones
- be careful about "intuitive truths"
